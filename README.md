# Cirrhosis Predictor Project 📊
## Machine Learning Applied to Medical Data

### Overview 📑
This project applies various machine learning models to predict cirrhosis outcomes based on patient data. It involves data preprocessing, analysis, model training, and evaluation using techniques like KNN, DecisionTree, and SVM. The goal is to accurately predict patient outcomes (survived, survived with transplant, or deceased).

### Features 🛠️
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling of missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Utilization of multiple machine learning models to predict the outcome variable 'Status'.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Detailed analysis of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Execution 🚀
To run the analysis:
1. Ensure Python and required libraries (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib) are installed.
2. Execute the Jupyter Notebook `Cirrhosis_Notebook.ipynb` to view the process and results.

### Key Findings 🔍
- **Data Insights**: Detailed statistical analysis and handling of various features such as Drug, Age, Sex, and Bilirubin.
- **Model Performance**: KNN provided the best results among the models tested, showing robust prediction capabilities.

### Conclusion 📝
The project highlights the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in medical data analysis, providing insights into patient outcomes and potential treatments.
